## Migrating Database

Now that we have configured the server, installed all the requirements, and configure our environment variables, now we can migrate our database. This process will create the tables for the database, so the project can store data structurally. 

Ensure that your virtual environment is activated, and you are navigated to the project folder in the command-line.

Enter: `python3 manage.py migrate --settings=config.settings.production`

You should see a lot of "Applying" statements. This is currently migrating all the migrations to the database.

You may notice at the beginning, there's a message about psycopg2. You can ignore it, as the latest version of that package does not work with Django CMS.

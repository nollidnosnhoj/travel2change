## Configuring Server

Now that the project is in the server, we need to configure the server, so we can start running it.

### But Before that...

`/home/username/` = This is your home directory. All of your projects, scripts, configurations, etc. are held in this directory. `username` refers to the username of your Django Europe account.

`project-name` = This is the project name in slug form, or your project slug that was autogenerated in the Django auto-installer. When you created a Django installation through Django Europe, it creates a project folder, based on your project slug, in your home directory. This is where all your project files are located.

Login to the server using WinSCP and let's get started.

### Configuring init script

Go to `/home/username/init/` 

This directory contains all the initializing scripts. They will receive start and stop arguments. 

On WinSCP, **find the file** that has your `project-name`. **Right click**, and **click Edit**. The internal editor show open up. 

**The file should not have any file extension**

*This script control whether the website should start or stop.*

On **line 15**, replace the line with:

`PYTHONPATH="$HOME/$NAME/project-name:$PROJECT_DIR/project-name"`

*replace `project-name` with the project slug, or the value of the $NAME variable*

On **line 22**, replace the line with:

`OPTS="-D -b unix:///$SOCKET --worker-class gevent --workers $WORKERS --pid $PIDFILE config.wsgi:application"`

### Configuring nginx conf

Edit `/home/nollidnosnhoj/nginx/conf/sites/project-name.conf`

On **line 20**, replace line with:

`alias ../project-name/staticfiles/;`

On **line 23**, replace line with:

`alias ../project-name/media/;`

### Enabling Virtual Environment

Time to go to the command-line. Login to the SSH. Once you are logged in, **type**:

`source ~/.virtualenvs/project-name/bin/activate` 

The virtual environment is activated when you see the project name (surrounded by parentheses).

The virtual environment will allow you to work with Django commands and install Python packages.

Last thing, **go to the project folder**. `cd project-name`

### Installing Requirements

Now we need to install all the packages and dependencies that the project needs.

**Enter**: `pip3 install -r requirements/production.txt`

The command-line should start installing a numerous packages, including Django and Django CMS.

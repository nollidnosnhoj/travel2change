## Django Admin

Django comes with an admin control panel where users with superuser or staff status can view objects, and add, change, or delete objects.

*For staff users, they have access to the admin panel; however, they do not have specified permissions to modify or view objects. If you want to create a group of staff users that have specific permissions, you will have to create a Group for them.*

*But we will discuss that later.*

*Superuser not only have access to the admin control panel, but they have all permissions for every object in the project.*

The sections in the admin control panel are split up into applications, and each row represents a model (object). 

Let us go through some sections, and discuss about them.

### Accounts

This section is part of the [Django AllAuth](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) application. It has one object: **Email Address**

This object stores all the email addresses that was used for registration. You can see which email was verified or not.

### Activities

This section is the Activities application, where all the activities related data are stored. We have **Activities, Categories, Regions, and Tags** objects.

Let us explore more of the Activities application. Click on the **Categories** link

This is where we can see a list of categories created. If we click **Add category**, we can create a category. 

In the Add category page, this is where we input data about the category.

Once you save it, you can view it in the Categories list.

You can click on an object (category) to edit them. If you want to delete a category, click on a checkbox next to it, and open the dropdown menu and choose **Delete Selected**, and click **Go**.

Same goes with Regions, Tags, and Activities.

### Authentication and Authorization

In this application, there is one object: **Group**

As mentioned before, Group is where you can group users to have specific permissions. When creating the website, one group was created: **Moderators**.

Here we can select what permissions from what is available that group has. Whenever a new model is migrated to the database, it creates a view, change, delete, and add permissions for that model. For **Moderators**, the users could add, change, delete, and view activities and activity photos in the admin panel. This is needed when they moderate the activities and approve/disapprove them.

### Axes

This section is for [Django Axes](https://github.com/jazzband/django-axes). Axes allow staff and superusers to keep track of failed login attempts for the login and administration views. Users can view access attempts and logs. The purpose of this package is to prevent users from brute forcing by configuring a login attempt limit. Axes also support IP address whitelisting and blacklisting, user account whitelisting, and other features for Django access management. You can read more in their [documentation](https://django-axes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### Django CMS

This section allows you manage Django CMS pages and permissions. 

Page Types - Page Types makes it easier for content editors to create pages from predefined types. You can read more [here](http://docs.django-cms.org/en/latest/how_to/page_types.html).

Pages - Pages allow staff to create pages for the website. 

Pages global permission - This is where a user or group can be given CMS permissions on all the Django CMS pages.

Static placeholders - These are placeholders for plugins that display the same content in multiple locations of the website. I would personally not worry about this as much, since [you can add placeholder tags onto the templates](http://docs.django-cms.org/en/latest/introduction/02-templates_placeholders.html#static-placeholders). 

The last two objects (User groups (page) and Users (page)) are something I would not worry about, as using the Django CMS Toolbar would be much easier.

### Django CMS Modules

Django CMS Modules allow users to add copy/paste capabilities to groups of plugins. I would not worry about this, as using the Django CMS Toolbar is much easier.

### Favorites

When a user favorites an activity, what they are actually doing is creating a Favorite object that has their user instance and the activity instance in it. You can view, add, change, or delete favorites, but it is recommended to leave it in the front end.

### Filer

This application came with Django CMS, and it's a file management system. If you decide to add files to the Django CMS page, it will be stored here. You can also add thumbnail options for the images in the Django CMS pages.

### Points

This is the reward points system. We will discuss this more in-depth, but to briefly discuss this.

**Awarded Points** - keeps track of all the points given to a user.

**Point value** - gives a value of points a key.

### Redirects 

This is a way of updating an existing URL without compromising your Website SEO or in any case avoid 404 errors. 

### Sites

This is the information for the site. You can have multiple sites in one project, but it is recommended to just have one, as we did not develop the project with the intent of having multiple sites. You could check if the domain name of the one site is correct, because that is how we can view the activities.

### Snippets

This is provided by Django CMS. It provides a plugin to inject HTML, CSS, or Javascript snippets into the website. If you need to add some HTML or CSS or Javascript into your Django CMS page, use Snippets. However, it is recommended to only use this during development, as this plugin has potential for security hazards. So just ignore this section.

### Social Accounts

This is provided by Django Allauth. This allows users to connect using their social media. Unfortunately, we did not have time to implement this feature fully, but we can briefly discuss about it. But to fully understand it, you can read the [documentation](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

The only section to really worry about it **Social applications**. This is where if you decide to allow user to connect to a social network, this is where you add their API client and secret keys.

To get the keys for a social network, please consult here: <https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/providers.html>

### Users

This is where all the users and hosts are located. You can view all **Users** or all **Hosts**. All Hosts are users, but not all users are hosts. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/wmipYEh.png)

Here we can see the list of users that have registered. You can see the amount of points each user has, and you can sort them by clicking the attribute label.

When a user registers, they have an option to create a Host Profile. If they enable that option, it will create a host object for that user account. If not, it won't create it, and if the user wants a host profile, they will need to contact a staff user so someone can manually create a Host object.

# Understanding the Project

The framework used in this project is called Django. Django is a web framework designed in Python. Django structures the project into applications, and within each applications are:

- `admin.py` - This is how you configure the admin site for the application. [Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/contrib/admin/).
- `apps.py` - This is to help users to include application configuration for the application. [Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/applications/#configuring-applications).
- `forms.py` - This is how forms are created. Think of this file as a helper for creating forms. We need helpers to create forms, especially form that accepts user input, as we cannot trust them as much as we want to. [Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/forms/).
- `models.py` - Models are a single, definite source of information about your data. it contains essential fields and behaviors of the data you are storing. For instance, in the activities application, there is a `models.py` which contains data and behaviors for categories, regions, tags, and, of course, activities.
  However, when you make a change to a model, like the field types or options, you must make a migration by entering: `python manage.py makemigrations app-name`. `app-name` is the name of the application that has the modified `models.py`. Running this command will create a migration file in the application's migration folder. [Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/db/models/). **It is important to not remove these migrations since they will depend on other migrations. Remove a migration that another migration depends on will break the migration.**
- `tests.py` - This is where you can do unit testing for your application. This is great for testing an individual component of the project, like applications. We have used this for testing, but removed it from the project. [Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/testing/overview/).
- `urls.py` - This is where all the URL routing goes. The module will map a URL path expression (usually regex expression), to a function or class-based view. [Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/http/urls/).
- `views.py` - These are classes or functions that takes a Web request and returns a Web response. This response can be a HTML page, redirect, error page, or an image. [Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/http/views/). For this project, we primarily used class-based views since it is easier to configure, but may be difficult to follow. [Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/class-based-views/).

Of course, you can add more files into the application folder, like `mixins.py` or `business-logic.py` .

## Config Folder

The config folder contains settings for the website. It contains a `urls.py` file that acts as a global URL dispatch, instead of an application based URL dispatcher. `wsgi.py` is the primary deployment platform for Django. [Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/howto/deployment/wsgi/).

Inside the config folder is the settings folder. This is where all the settings for the project are located. Most (if not all) of the settings in these files are commented to describe what they do. You can also import settings into another application by `from django.conf import settings`.

- `base.py` - The base settings for the project.
- `local.py` - Settings that should be used for development only.
- `production.py` - Settings that should be used for production only.
- `tests.py` - Settings that should be used for testing only.

In each file, most settings should be commented on what it does.

`.env` file is the environment variable file that contains sensitive information.

## Media and Static files

When a user uploads a media to the website, it will be stored in a folder called `media` in the root directory of the project. This is configured in the `base.py` file in the settings folder. [Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/files/).

Static files are files that are not dynamic, like stylesheets, images, and Javascript. The static folder is located in the travel2change folder (not the root directory). [Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/howto/static-files/).

## Templates

Templates are HTML file that has templating syntax in them that will generate dynamic content for the page. This is how whenever you visit an activity, it contains that activity's information on the page.

The template should be structured by applications. So if you are creating a template for an activity, you should place that template in the application folder, that is in the templates folder.

The naming convention for the template also matters. You should name the template `application_typeofview.html`

Replace `application` with the name of the application, and typeofview with the type of template it is. For instance, if you are creating a template for the activity detail page, the template name should be `activity_detail.html`.

## travel2change Applications

**Activities** - Application that handles the activities in the project. This allows user to create, modify, view, and delete activities.

**Favorites** - Application that handles all the favoriting of activities. This allow users to favorite activities.

**Moderations** - Application that handles the moderation of the activities. This allows for users with permissions to moderate activities.

**Reviews** - Application that handles the reviews for each activity. This allows users to create a review for an activity.

**Points** - Application that handles the points system.

**Users** - Application that handles all the users and hosts. The user is a custom user model that only accepts an email address (not a username).

<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/auth/customizing/#specifying-a-custom-user-model>

**To create a new application, enter this in the command line:**

`python manage.py startapp app-name`

You may need to move the app folder from the root to travel2change folder.

## Updating models.py

If you modify an application's `models.py`, then you will need to make a migration of this change. Migrations are Django's way of propagating changes you made to the models into your database schema. In your local environment (assuming your virtual environment is enabled), enter:

`python manage.py makemigrations app-name`

### replacing app-name with the name of the application

This will create a migration file in the application's migration folder. As mentioned before, do not remove any of the migration files since another migration may depend on it.

However, you will need to apply these migrations into the database, enter:

`python manage.py migrate`

To see all your migrations: `python manage.py showmigrations`

If you want to reset your migrations, you can refer to [this article](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2016/07/26/how-to-reset-migrations.html).

### Django CMS

Django CMS is a CMS framework for Django that allows for content management. While Django CMS is great for frontend work, it is also very developer friendly, allowing developers to customize Django CMS through code.

## Pulling Project

Now we need to get the latest travel2change files to the server. But first, let's login to WinSCP. Once you are logged into the remote server, you should be able to see `home/username/` on the right hand side, while the left hand side is your local computer documents. 

In `home/username/` , go the the travel2change folder.

**AGAIN, WE ASSUME THE PROJECT NAME IS `travel2change`**

Next delete the following folders/files:

```
/config/
/dproject/
/imprint/
/requirements/
manage.py
```

Let's start pulling the project. There are two ways to do this: uploading using WinSCP, or pulling using Git. 

**The easiest way is to just upload the files to the server.** 

### Upload to WinSCP

Go to https://www.github.com/nollidnosnhoj/travel2change/

Click the green button that says "Clone and download" then click "Download ZIP"

Once downloaded, extract the zip file, and open the folder. Inside `travel2change-master` are the contents for the project. These contents need to be uploaded to the server `home/username/project-name/` 

To upload these files, drag the files into WinSCP.

Once it finishes uploading, you have successfully uploaded the project.

### Pull using Git

Login to SSH using the command-line. `ssh username@hostname`

Type: `cd project-name` 

Go to https://www.github.com/nollidnosnhoj/travel2change/

and create a Github account. Afterwards, go back to the repository, and Fork the repo (in the top-right). This will create a clone of the repository to your Github account.

Afterwards, go to your forked repo, and click on the Green button "Clone or download" and copy the HTTPS url. Look something like this:

`https://github.com/nollidnosnhoj/travel2change.git`

Go back to your command-line and 

**Initialize git**

`git init` 

**Set your remote URL**

`git remote add origin https://github.com/nollidnosnhoj/travel2change.git`

**To verify that your remote URL is set**

`git remote -v` 

**Pull your project**

`git pull origin master` 

You may need to add `--allow-unrelated-histories` at the end.

**You have successfully pulled the project using Git**

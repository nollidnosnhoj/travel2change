# Travel2Change

travel2change was a software project where our goal was to create a web application for our client that meets their requirements. The website uses were for both travelers and communities. Communities can host an event for tourists to attend and experience cultural activities in Hawaii, like a local luau or cleaning the beach. Tourists can also use this website to find any local activities.

Unfortunately, we do not have a demo site anymore since we cannot afford to host the site forever.

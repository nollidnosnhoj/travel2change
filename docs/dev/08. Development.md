# Development

You have set up the website. Congratulations!

Now, what if you want to make changes to the project. Well, you can!

You can setup a development environment on your local machine (computer) so you can setup a development server to do testing and updating.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
  - To install Python onto your local computer, [read here](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/python_installation/).
- Git
  - <https://gitforwindows.org/>
  - Git should come installed with Mac or Linux
  - <https://desktop.github.com/> - GitHub GUI

Create a folder somewhere in your computer where the development should take place.  For instance: `C:\Development\`

## Create virtual environment

This tutorial does a very good job explaining how to setup virtual environment.

[](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/django_installation/#virtual-environment)

Make sure you activate your virtual environment.

## Pull from Github

If you forked the project into your own Github account, copy the repository link of your forked repo.

In your development directory on your local machine, initialize git: `git init`. This will initialize your local git repository.

Add your repository to your remote URL: `git remote add origin <paste_here>`

You can verify if it added by: `git remote -v`

Pull the project: `git pull origin master`

What pull does is that brings all the files to your local repo and merge the existing files.

### Note, that this process is a lot easier using Github Desktop

<https://help.github.com/en/desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop>

You could also just download the project from the project repository, and just place the files into your development directory.

## Install Requirements

Go to the directory that contains `manage.py` and enter:

`python -m pip install -r requirements/local.txt`

We are using local.txt because this is for local development, which this text file contains debugging packages.

## Setup ENV for Development

Rename `config/settings/.env.example` to `config/settings/.env`

Start editing the `.env` file.

Remove `#` in: `# DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3`

In `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` , it should be

    DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.local

Generate secret key for `SECRET_KEY`. [Generate key here.](â€‹https://www.miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/)

Make sure `DEBUG=True`

Replace `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=[insert domain]` with

    DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=.127.0.0.1

`SITE_DOMAIN` should be `SITE_DOMAIN=127.0.0.1:8000`

Insert your Google Maps API in `GOOGLE_MAPS_API`

## Lastly

Migrate your database: `python manage.py migrate`

and create superuser: `python manage.py createsuperuser`

and create initial data: `python manage.py create_init_data`

You can now `python manage.py runserver` but you will need to setup website. Refer to **0.7 Configuring Website**

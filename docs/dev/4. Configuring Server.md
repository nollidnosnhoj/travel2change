## Configuring Server

Now that the project is in the server, we need to configure the server, so we can start running it.

Login to the server using WinSCP and let's get started.

### Configuring init script

Go to `/home/username/init/` 

On WinSCP, right click on the file with the name of your project, and Click Edit.

This script allows you to start, stop, or restart the server.

On **line 15**, replace the line with:

`PYTHONPATH="$HOME/$NAME/project-name:$PROJECT_DIR/project-name"`

*replace `project-name` with the name of the project, or the value of $NAME*

On **line 22**, replace the line with:

`OPTS="-D -b unix:///$SOCKET --worker-class gevent --workers $WORKERS --pid $PIDFILE config.wsgi:application"`

### Configuring nginx conf

Edit `/home/nollidnosnhoj/nginx/conf/sites/project-name.conf`

On **line 20**, replace line with:

`alias ../project-name/staticfiles/;`

On **line 23**, replace line with:

`alias ../project-name/media/;`

### Enabling Virtual Environment

Time to go to the command-line. Login to the SSH. Once you are logged in, type:

`source ~/.virtualenvs/project-name/bin/activate/` 

*Replace project-name with the name of the project.*

The virtual environment is activated when you see the project name (surrounded by parentheses) next to the ssh user.

The virtual environment will allow you to work with Django commands and install Python packages.

Last thing, go to the project folder `cd project-name`

### Installing Requirements

Now we need to install all the packages and dependencies that the project needs.

Enter: `pip3 install -r requirements/production.txt`

The command-line should start installing a numerous packages, including Django and Django CMS.

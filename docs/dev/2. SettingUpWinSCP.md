## Setting up WinSCP and SSH

In this section, we will walkthrough how to setup WinSCP and how to use SSH on the command line. We will use both of these tools to access and manage the files for our project. 

### Setting up WinSCP

1. Download and install [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php). 
2. When launching WinSCP, it will ask you to create a new session (login to a server).

   1. **File protocol:** SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)
   2. **Host name:** This is the server that your SSH user can login to. If you do not know, go to the Django Europe control panel. Click **SSH users**. Find your SSH user, and under the **Server** column is where you **host name** is located.

   3. **User name:** The username of the SSH user. Again, you can find it under SSH users in the Django Europe control panel. It should be under the **Name** column.
   4. **Password:** This is the password of the SSH user. You may need to setup a password for your SSH user. To do so, go to the **SSH users** in the Django Europe control panel. In the row containing your SSH user, click on the edit icon on the right (second icon from the left). Under **Authentication**, there should be a **Password** field. Click **Change** or **Enable** to setup a new password for your SSH login.
   5. **Port number:** Leave it at **22**. 
3. Once you fill out the session information, save it and login to that session. It may ask you to enter the password.
4. Once you are authenticated, you will have access to the files in the server `\home\your-username\` .

### Access server using SSH

Open the command prompt or terminal (depending on your operating system), and enter `ssh username@hostname` . Replace username with your SSH username, and host name with the host name of the SSH user. You will need to insert your SSH password.

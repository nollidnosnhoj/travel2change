# Configuration Website

*Before you proceed:* Please make sure that the database has been migrated, and the server is up and running.

This section will begin configuring the website, and auto-populating the site with data, like categories, tags, and regions.

But first, a superuser need to be created so you could login to the website, since there is no user in the database.

`manage.py createsuperuser --settings=config.settings.production`

## Creating Sample Data

`create_init_data.py`

This script will update the site domain to the site domain specified in the environment variable.

The script will also create a Django group called **Moderators** that has the permissions to only view, add, edit, and delete activities in the admin panel.

### To run this initial scripts: enter

`manage.py create_init_data.py --settings=config.settings.production`

## Creating Point Value Data

`create_pointvalue.py`

This script will create point value for the points system. This will be discussed later.

### To run this script: enter

`manage.py create_pointvalue.py --settings=config.settings.production`  

## Collect Static Files

This script will collect all the static files (stylesheet, javascript, etc.) found on the project and its dependencies, and place them in the `STATIC_ROOT` specified in `settings` folder so that it could be served to the client when it goes live.

`python3 manage.py collectstatic --settings=config.settings.production`

When asked to overwrite files, type `yes`.

Once collecting the static files is completed, you need to restart the nginx server.

`~/init/nginx restart`

## Installing Memcached

Memcached is a distributed memory caching system that often used to speed up dynamic database-driven website, by caching data and objects in RAM. We will need to install this to boost the speed of the website.

You could also refer to this Django Europe Article: [Memcached Article](<https://panel.djangoeurope.com/faq/memcache>)

### First, we need to create an UNIX socket file

`/usr/bin/memcached -s ~/memcached.sock`

Then navigate to `~/init/` and create a `memcached` file. You could do this in WinSCP.

Inside `memcached` , insert this:

    #!/bin/bash

    # Set this to your memcached port and PID file

    PORT=XXXX
    IP=127.0.0.1
    PIDFILE=~/memcached.pid


    # Do not change anything below unless you know what you do

    DAEMON=/usr/bin/memcached
    NAME="memcached"
    PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
    OPTS="-s ~/memcached.sock -d -P $PIDFILE"
    #OPTS="-l $IP -p $PORT -d -P $PIDFILE" # Uncomment this line that memcache lists on a TCP port

    fail () {
        echo "failed!"
        exit 1
    }

    success () {
        echo "$NAME."
    }

    case "$1" in
      start)
          echo -n "Starting $NAME: "
          if start-stop-daemon --start --quiet --pidfile $PIDFILE --exec $DAEMON -- $OPTS ; then
            success
          else
            fail
          fi
        ;;
      stop)
          echo -n "Stopping $NAME: "
          if start-stop-daemon --stop --quiet --oknodo --retry 30 --pidfile $PIDFILE --exec $DAEMON ; then
            success
          else
            fail
          fi
        ;;
      reload)
          echo -n "Reloading $NAME configuration: "
          if ! eval "$DAEMON -t $OPTS" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
            eval "$DAEMON -t $OPTS"
            fail
          fi
          if start-stop-daemon --stop --signal 2 --oknodo --retry 30 --quiet --pidfile $PIDFILE --exec $DAEMON; then
            if start-stop-daemon --start --quiet --pidfile $PIDFILE --exec $DAEMON -- $OPTS ; then
              success
            else
              fail
            fi
          else
            fail
          fi
        ;;
      restart)
          $0 stop
          [ -r  $PIDFILE ] && while pidof memcached |\
              grep -q `cat $PIDFILE 2>/dev/null` 2>/dev/null ; do sleep 1; done
          $0 start
        ;;
      *)
          echo "Usage: $0 {start|stop|restart|reload}"
          exit 1
    esac

In `PORT=XXXX` , replace `XXXX` with the nginx port. You can find it in the Django Europe Control Panel. Select Ports on the sidebar.

### Save the file

Then enter: `chmod +x ~/init/memcached`

Now we can run memcache by entering:

`~/init/memcached start`

## Running the Server

Now we have setup everything, we can actually start running the server. In the command-line, enter:

`~/init/project-name restart`

This will restart the server, since it was running the whole time. You can now enter your website by entering your domain, and you should be treated with this:

![Django CMS Login](https://i.imgur.com/YbhfQUe.png)

Remember that superuser we created, use that to login.

We have now successfully logged in!

![Login Successful](https://i.imgur.com/rzZd3ew.png)

Now let's setup some pages, and an application.

### Setting Up Pages

The objective for this section is to create a homepage, and hook our activities application to Django CMS.

To create a homepage, click on **New Page**.

In **Title**, enter `Home` , and then click Create in the bottom right.

![Create Homepage](https://i.imgur.com/QEOu5DY.png)

Once you create the homepage, you will receive a server error. **This is normal**, because we need to create another page that hooks our activities application to Django CMS. And the homepage possesses contents that looks for the activities app.

In your web browser, go to `http://domain.name/admin` (Go to the Django admin)

You are now in the Django admin page. Under **Django CMS** click **Pages**.

![Pages](https://i.imgur.com/um2XDPl.png)

You are presented with the Django CMS Page Tree.

![Pages](https://i.imgur.com/SNnqqLz.png)

As you can see, the Home page we created is actually the homepage, as indicated by the Home icon next to View.

Let's get rid of that nasty server error on the homepage, and create a **New Page**.

For this page, title should be `Activities` . Also make sure the slug is `activities`

Click **Save and continue editing**.

On the bottom, click **Advanced Settings**

There should be a dropdown menu called **Application**. Choose `Activity Apphook`.

The activity application has a Django CMS apphook so that Django CMS knows that this application exists.

A new field called `Application Instance Name` should appear, but just leave it as is `activities`.

![Activity Apphook](https://i.imgur.com/Q4gyNv2.png)

Click **Save**

Now we need to publish the Activities page.

In the **Page Tree**, on the **Activities** Row, **EN** column, click the **gray circle**, and then click **Publish**.

![Activities Publish](https://i.imgur.com/pNyRaup.png)

We have successfully publish the activities page, but we are not done yet. We need to reset the server. Now, Django CMS states that it does it automatically, but we like to make sure.

In your command-line, enter:

`~/init/project-name restart`

Go back to the website, and you are now greeted with a nice homepage with a nice search bar.

# Setting up WinSCP and SSH

In this section, we will walkthrough how to setup WinSCP and how to use SSH on the command line. We will use both of these tools to access and manage the files for our project.

## Setting up WinSCP

1. Download and install [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php).

2. When launching WinSCP, it will ask you to create a new session (login to a server).

   1. **File protocol:** SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)

   2. **Host name:** This is where you type the name, or the IP address, of the server you want to connect to. To find out the host name, login to the Django Europe control panel, and click **SSH users**. Find your SSH user and look at the **Server** column.

   3. **User name:** This is your Django Europe username.

   4. **Password:** This is your Django Europe password. If not, you may need to set it up. Go to the Django Europe control panel, click **SSH users**, click on the **Edit** button under **Actions** (second icon), under **Authentication** is where you can setup/change your account password.

   5. **Port number:** Leave it at **22**. This is the port number that you will be connected to on the server. It is rare to specify the port number, so leaving it as 22 is fine.

3. Once you fill out the session information, save it and login to that session. It may ask you to enter the password.

4. Once you are authenticated, you will have access to the files in the server `\home\your-username\` .

## Access server using SSH

Once the command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac or Linux), and enter `ssh username@hostname`. Replace the username with your account username and hostname with the host name or IP address of the server. Afterwards, you will be prompted to enter your account password.

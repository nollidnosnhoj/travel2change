# Resources

Thank you for allowing us to create the website for you. We cannot fit a lot of the information about the tools and frameworks we used into this documentation, then it would be a lot to read. I tried by best to add information that is essential to the deployment of the project. So, I decided to add some links if you want to learn more. These articles and documentations are very high quality.

If you have any questions about the project, or found errors in the documentation, let us know!

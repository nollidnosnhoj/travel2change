## Hosting Setup

This documentation assumes that the website will be hosted at [Django Europe](https://www.djangoeurope.com). 

1. Login to the Django Europe control panel.

2. Click **Installer** on the left sidebar.

3. Click **Django**.

4. Fill out the information.

   1. **Choose a SSH User**. This is the username that will allow you to login to SSH. SSH is a protocol that allows the user to remote access a server. 

   2. **Database**. Make sure you choose the Database user that has `- psql` on the end. This means that the user uses the PostgreSQL database management system. If you do not see it, on the left sidebar, click Database. Under Database users, click **Add User**. From there, choose your **System User (SSH User)**, choose **PostgreSQL** DBMS, choose whatever **name** and **password**. If the password field is left blank, the password will be auto-generated.

      It is important to note that the database that will created by the auto-installer will not be used, since it auto-generates data, which we do not want.

   3. **Project settings**. Name the project of this Django installation. In this case, this will be the name of the website, like `travel2change`. It is important to remember the name of the project. The database name is also based on the name of the project name, but remember, we will not use the database that is auto-created. In Django version, choose **Django 2.1.X**; although it may not matter.

      **IMPORTANT: THROUGHOUT THE DOCUMENTATION, IT IS GOING TO ASSUME THAT YOU NAMED THE PROJECT `travel2change`. IF YOU RENAME IT, REPLACE `travel2change` IN THE DOC TO THE NAME OF THE PROJECT**

   4. **Django admin**. Fill out the credentials for the admin user. This may not be necessary as we will create a new database. 

   5. **Domain**. Choose what domain name you want the project to use. You can also choose a subdomain for this project.

5. Once the information is filled, click Install. This will begin the installation process of the Django project. It is okay to leave the window. You will receive an email when the installation is complete.

6. As mentioned before, we will need to create a brand new database for the website, instead of using the auto-created database, since it is populated. *Note, you can use the auto-created database, but you will need to drop all the tables in that database.* 

   1. On the left sidebar, click Databases
   2. Under Database list, click Add database
   3. In the Add database modal window, choose the **PostgreSQL user**. Choose a **name**. In Database Type, choose **PostgreSQL**. A new section called **Extensions** will appear. You may not need any of them, but adding **Postgis** will be nice if you decide to add Geolocation to your project. Click **Create**.

**UNFORTUNATELY, you cannot name the database `travel2change` because it already exists when using the auto-installer. You can either name it something else, or delete the `travel2change` database, and recreate it.**

Once the project installation is completed, we can now start accessing the server backend remotely either using SSH command-line or a GUI-client called [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php). I would highly recommend WinSCP, but there will be times where we will need to use both command-line and WinSCP. 

### FAQ

**Q: Why are we using the auto-installer to create our Django project?**

A: The auto-installer will automatically create scripts that will help us launch the website into the Internet. It will also automatically create a port number for the project, and a website proxy.

# Importing Data

In the project, we added a feature called `django-import-export` where it allow you to import spreadsheet that contains data that can be imported into a Django model. Export will allow you to export a Django model into a spreadsheet.

You can either import/export:

- Category
- Region
- Tag
- Activity

Catogory, Tag, and Region will import and export these fields:

- id *(unique)*
- name
- slug *(alphanumeric, no whitespace, dashes and underscores okay)*

Activity will import and export these fields:

- id *(unique)*
- title
- host *(host primary key, host must exist in db)*
- slug *(alphanumeric, no whitespace, dashes and underscores okay)*
- description
- highlights *(new line = new item)*
- requirements *(new line = new item)*
- region *(region name, region must exist in db)*
- tags *(tag name, separated by commas, tag must exist in db)*
- categories *(category name, separated by commas, category must exist in db)*
- address
- latitude *(must be 9 digits, and 6 decimals places)*
- longitude *(must be 9 digits, and 6 decimals places)*
- price *(must be positive number)*
- fh_item_id *(must be positive integer)*
- status *(either approved, unapproved, or inactive)*

Let's import Regions as an example

## Creating the Spreadsheet

Create the spreadsheet, and make sure the columns are in the exact order as the fields listed above.

Notice that the slug column, the data has no whitespaces, but instead replaced with hypens. You could also leave it blank, and it will auto-generate a slug.

Also, I added no data under the id column, because that will get auto-generated.

## Import Data

Go to the Region object in the Django admin. Click on Import left of the Add Region button.

Choose the spreadsheet, and select the format of the spreadsheet you are uploading.

Click Submit, and it will take you to a preview of the new data being imported. Click Submit, and your new regions should be created.

## Importing Activity Data

Importing activity data is a bit tricky because there are four relational keys: host, region, tags, and categories.

To add data in the host column, you need to enter the primary key (id) of the host. You can find the pk by viewing the Hosts in the Django admin, and the pk column should be the most left column.

For region, you need to enter the slug of the region. You can find that out in the Region section in Django admin.

For categories, you need to enter the slug of the region. If there's more than one, separate each with a whitespace.

Same with the tags.

### The host, region, categories, and tags data in the spreadsheet must exist in the website's database

For requirements and highlights, you cannot add new line (unless maybe you could in Excel). If not, add some sort of separator to remember, and when you manual edit the activity, change the separator to a new line.

### We have not fully tested importing Activity data

## Example spreadsheets

You can locate some example spreadsheets for tags, regions, and categories located in:

    /spreadsheets/

## Customize Import-Export

All the import and exports are located in:

    /travel2change/activities/admin.py

[Refer to the Django Import Export Documentation](https://django-import-export.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Exporting Data

Now let's export the regions. Click Export next to the Add region button. Then choose a format for your spreadsheet. Click submit, and download the file.

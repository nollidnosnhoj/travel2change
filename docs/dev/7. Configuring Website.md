## Configuration Website

*Before you proceed:* Please make sure that the database has been migrated, and the server is up and running. 

This section will take you through configuring the website. First thing we need to do is execute some initial scripts. These scripts will create crucial data that will jumpstart this website.

**HOWEVER**, before we run scripts, we need to create a super user so someone can access the website. Through the command-line, enter: `manage.py createsuperuser` . From there, it will take you through the signup form.

**Initial Scripts**

- `create_init_data.py` - This script will update the site information (SITE_NAME and SITE_DOMAIN). This script will also create some regions, categories, and tags, based on the previous travel2change website.

To run this initial scripts: enter `manage.py create_init_data.py` 

Again, this will generate all the categories, tags, and regions, and update the site name and domain.

- `create_pointvalue.py` - This script will create pointvalue for the points system. This will be discussed later.

To run this script: enter `manage.py create_pointvalue.py`
